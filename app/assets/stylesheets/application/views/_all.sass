// views ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// this file pulls in view specific stylesheets

// directories follow a controller/action structure like rails views

// these files are for styles that don't fit into any specific module or
// aren't part of the general layout. they typically aid in positioning or
// are used for design elements that only exist on one page of the site


// example import
// @import dashboard/index
